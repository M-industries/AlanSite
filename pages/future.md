Some of the things we want to work on include (in no particular order):

- Dynamic permissions
- Personal todos
- Reduce memory usage of the client
- Password reset + user creation flow
- Enhance security (always good to enhance security)
- Translations for fixed elements in the client (login, messages, etc)

- Make it easier to work with file properties locally

- Improved querying, reporting and dataviz features
- Improve support for live dashboard like clients
