Alan is already used by [M-industries](https://www.m-industries.com) and [Kjerner](https://www.kjerner.com/) to build solutions for their customers. However, we're not done yet improving the platform and creating new and better features. 

Long term plans include:

- Todos should become a primary driver for the interaction with an application. 
- Persistent (server-side) user profiles and preferences.
- Improved querying, reporting and data visualization features.
- Improved support for creating "live dashboard" applications.
- We're forever trying to drive down memory usage and improve computation performance of the entire platform.
