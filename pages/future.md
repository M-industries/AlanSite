Alan is already used by [M-industries](https://www.m-industries.com) and [Kjerner](https://www.kjerner.com/) to build solutions for their customers. However, we're not done yet improving the platform and creating new and better features. 

Long term plans include:

- Open up our online development and hosting solution for quick experiments and proof of concept by any developer
- Extend the generated GUI so that there are even less reasons to go with a custom gui
- Make custom gui's (on the platform) easily extendible for third-party control & widget developers
- Make todo's the primary driver for the interaction with an application. 
- Improved querying, reporting and data visualization features.
- Improved support for creating "live dashboard" applications.
- Making development more accessible to first-time application developers by providing a graphical modeler
- Providing a marketplace for applications, external connectors and gui controls & widgets
- Create more and more powerful application logic imports (we can already create an application model based on a database model)
