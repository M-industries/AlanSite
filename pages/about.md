In Alan data models drive everything.
The unique application modeling language allows you to write a model that generates both a database design and a user interface. It's a fast way to create and iterate on your application, without sacrificing data correctness. It has been in continous development by a dedicated team since 2011.


## Features
The platform already has more features than we've been able to document. But here are some of them:
- Bug-free applications by design, so no unit testing required
- An application language modeling: data, calculations and tranformations, numerical types, authorization, procedures and workflow
- Generated GUI's that fully work and can customized by annotations on the application model.
- Custom GUI's in Alan that enable you to make something very specific, without loosing the full error-checking capabilities of Alan
- All GUI's supprt authentication, internationalization, live data and independent platform updates
- Our system interface language enables you to describe a system interface in one integrated whole and map it safely to an application model, two-way

If your project requires something like this, get in touch and we'll help you get set up:

  - Reading from relational databases.
  - Writing to relational databases.
  - Creating a relational database mirror.
  - Migrate from a running system, and then replace it.
  - Archive a system, download data, migrate and then upload.
  - Upgrading system runtimes.
  - Backup routines.

## Kjerner
Kjerner took over development of the Alan platform from M-industries since the beginning of 2019. M-industries built the Alan platform to help international businesses like Tata Steel and Hydro improve data quality and upgrade their legacy systems.
We're based near the campus of Delft University of Technology and you can find us here:
