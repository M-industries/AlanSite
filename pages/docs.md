Don't be afraid to ask questions [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/alan) (use the `#alan` tag)!

## Working with Alan on Windows
Alan, the related tools and compilers, are built to run in a Unix-like environment. We rely on tools like bash and curl that are native to Linux and macOS. 

On Windows you can use the MinGW terminal (aka. Git Bash) provided by [Git-For-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org). Using our Linux builds in WSL or a Linux VM are also possible.

The Alan Application Server only runs on a "real" POSIX system. Run it in WSL under the Linux filesystem, or a VM or external Linux server.
