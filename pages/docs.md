## Get the Alan utility
If you start your project from the [template](https://github.com/M-industries/AlanProjectTemplate), it already has the `alan` utility in the root directory.

You can also download it here:

- [macOS](https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/darwin-x64/utils.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/linux-x64/utils.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/windows-x64/utils.tar.gz)


## Get the Alan server
Get an alan server by running this one-liner: 

macOs:
```sh
bash -c "mkdir -p data runenv/image && curl -s https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/darwin-x64/application-server.tar.gz | tar xzf - -C runenv/image && ln -s runenv/image/application-server serve"
```
Linux:
```sh
bash -c "mkdir -p data runenv/image && curl -s https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/linux-x64/application-server.tar.gz | tar xzf - -C runenv/image && ln -s runenv/image/application-server serve"
```

You can now start the server by running:
```sh
./serve 127.0.0.1 12345
```

> Tip: run this in a directory dedicated to the server as it will download additional utilities and create directories.


## Alan and Windows
Alan is built to run in a Unix-like environment. We rely on tools like bash and curl that are native to Linux and macOS. 

On Windows you can use the MinGW terminal (aka. Git Bash) provided by [Git-For-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org). Using our Linux builds in WSL or a Linux VM are also possible.

The Alan runtime only runs on a "real" Unix-like system. Run it in WSL under the Linux filesystem, a VM (e.g. via [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)) or an external Linux server (you can rent [a VPS](https://duckduckgo.com/vps%20hosting) for a few dollars a month).


## Languages

### How to read grammars

- Keywords are between `[]`, e.g. `'state group' [ '?' ] reference`.
- `component 'some component'` refers to a different component in the same language.


### Typical quirks of the Alan compiler

- Keywords should be separated by whitespace, so `()` doesn't work but `( )` does. 
- Quotes are recognized as something special, so you *can* write `'type':` and `?'state group'|'state'`.
- Single quotes are used for entities (things you can refer to or that refer to something else), double quotes are just strings.
- Only tabs are accepted for indentation.
