## How to read grammars

- Keywords are between `[]`, e.g. `'state group' [ '?' ] reference`.
- `component 'some component'` refers to a different component in the same language.

## Typical quirks of the Alan compiler

- Keywords should be separated by whitespace, so `()` doesn't work but `( )` does. 
- Quotes are recognized as something special, so you *can* write `'type':` and `?'state group'|'state'`.
- Single quotes are used for entities (things you can refer to or that refer to something else), double quotes are just strings.
- Only tabs are accepted for indentation.

## Alan and Windows
Alan is built to run in a Unix-like environment. We rely on tools like bash and curl that are native to Linux and macOS. 

On Windows you can use the MinGW terminal (aka. Git Bash) provided by [Git-For-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org). Using our Linux builds in WSL or a Linux VM are also possible.

The Alan Application Server only runs on a "real" POSIX system. Run it in WSL under the Linux filesystem, or a VM or external Linux server.
