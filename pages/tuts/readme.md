## How to use Alan
Basic steps to build your project:

1. `./alan bootstrap`
2. `./alan build`
3. `./alan package devenv/output/project.definition deployments/demo`


## Getting Alan
You can download the `alan` utility, and the tools it uses, here:

- [macOS](https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/darwin-x64.tar.gz)
- [Linux](https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/linux-x64.tar.gz)
- [Windows](https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/windows-x64.tar.gz)

You can put `alan` in your project root and call it from there. In some cases it's easier to make it available everywhere via `$PATH`. 

Note that `alan` will download its dependencies into an alan-tools directory. 



## Getting an Alan Application Server
Get a server by running a one-liner in a Unix-like shell:

MacOs:
```sh
bash -c "mkdir -p data runenv/image && curl -s https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/darwin-x64/application-server.tar.gz | tar xzf - -C runenv/image && ln -s runenv/image/application-server application-server"
```
Linux:
```sh
bash -c "mkdir -p data runenv/image && curl -s https://alan-platform.com/utils/latest/linux-x64/application-server.tar.gz | tar xzf - -C runenv/image && ln -s runenv/image/application-server application-server"
```

You can start the server by running:
```sh
./application-server 127.0.0.1 12345
```



## Modifying applications

1. Edit the application.alan
2. Run ./alan build
3. Update a migration to define the initial data



## Data Migration
Example layout for a migrations ("dataenv") environment:

```
migrations/
  ├ versions.json
  └ from_version_x/
      ├ build.json
      ├ migration.alan
      ├ regexp.alan
      ├ from/
      │   └ application.alan
      └ to/
          └ application.alan(.link)
```

> The versions.json would be the same as the one in your project, but with only the "datastore" system type and the platform version.

To build the migrations:

1. `./alan bootstrap`
2. `./alan build`

This will produce a `from_version_x.migration` package that can be used in a deployment. To do so, copy it to the deployment. In a very basic project the correct location would be `deployments/default/instances/server.migration`.



## Running an image on the server
Once you have a working server, you're ready to run an image on it.

One application server can manage multiple applications (aka "stacks").
Connect to the server ask for `--help` for a list of available commands.

The `--batch replace` command backups old stacks and can be used in scripts:

```
alan connect 127.0.0.1 12345 --batch replace "demo" image
```
